# aws-devops-projects
This repository contains hands-on AWS & DevOps projects that I built while learning and practicing core cloud services.
Each project focuses on one AWS concept, implemented step-by-step using the AWS Management Console and CLI, with screenshots and documentation.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical AWS knowledge, not just theory.
