# Project 08 – AWS Lambda with DynamoDB Integration

## Overview
This project demonstrates a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda
and Amazon DynamoDB. The Lambda function performs write and read
operations on a DynamoDB table.

## AWS Services Used
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon DynamoDB
- AWS IAM
- Amazon CloudWatch

## What I Did
- Created a DynamoDB table with on-demand capacity
- Created an IAM role allowing Lambda to access DynamoDB
- Developed a Lambda function using Python
- Inserted and retrieved data from DynamoDB using Lambda
- Verified execution output and database records

## Verification
The integration was verified by executing the Lambda function
with a test event and confirming data in DynamoDB.
Screenshots are available in the screenshots folder.

## Learning Outcome
- Understanding serverless architecture
- Lambda to DynamoDB integration
- IAM permissions for AWS services
- Event-driven data processing
