# Project 05 – AWS RDS with MySQL

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use Amazon RDS (MySQL) with an EC2 instance.
The EC2 instance connects to the RDS database, creates a database and table,
inserts data, and retrieves it successfully.

## Services Used
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon RDS (MySQL)
- Security Groups
- Amazon VPC (default)

## What I Did
- Created a MySQL RDS instance
- Configured security groups to allow EC2 to connect to RDS
- Installed MySQL client on EC2
- Connected EC2 to the RDS database
- Created a database and table
- Inserted and retrieved data using SQL queries

## Verification
The connection was verified by running SQL commands from the EC2 instance
and successfully retrieving data from the RDS database.

## Screenshots
Screenshots showing database creation, data insertion, and data retrieval
are available in the screenshots folder.

## Notes
This project focuses on database connectivity and basic SQL operations
required for DevOps and cloud infrastructure understanding.
