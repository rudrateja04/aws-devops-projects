# Project 07 – AWS Lambda Basics

## Overview
This project demonstrates the basic usage of AWS Lambda,
a serverless compute service provided by AWS.

The Lambda function executes code without using any server
and returns a response based on input data.

## AWS Services Used
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon CloudWatch
- AWS IAM

## What I Did
- Created a Lambda function using Python runtime
- Added a simple handler function
- Created a test event and executed the function
- Verified output and execution logs

## Verification
The function execution output was verified using the AWS
Lambda console. Screenshots are available in the screenshots folder.

## Learning Outcome
- Understanding serverless computing
- Event-driven execution model
- No server or infrastructure management required
